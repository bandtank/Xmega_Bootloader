Welcome to the XmegaBl. This bootloader implements the AVR911 protocol and is purposefully stripped of all the unnecessary bloat in an effort to keep it simple and efficient. 

Bootloader information:
   1. It works with all Xmegas, but may require you to add support if it isn't already in the makefile. Note: AVR-GCC has to support the particular Xmega you want to use as well. AVRDUDE 5.10 lacks support for many, many Xmegas, so you may need to acquire a newer version if you're simply using the bundled version that came with Winavr.
   2. It requires AVR-GCC to build.
   3. It uses the AVR911 protocol.
   4. It works with avrdude version 5.10 and Avr-OSP II version .549.
   5. Compilation size should be 2600-3000 bytes depending on the size of your AVR (>64k flash = bigger code).
   6. Unless you are adding support for unsupported baud rates or Xmegas, you do NOT need to edit any source code.

Bootloader Instructions (configure each setting in the makefile):
   1. It checks a pin (Active high/low and Pin/Port are configurable) for bootloader entry or application entry.
   2. An LED can be turned on when the bootloader is entered. Active high/low and Pin/Port are configurable.
   3. The default baud rate is 115200, but this can be set to anything you want.
 
How to configure:
   In the makefile, you will see the following block of text at the top of the file. You should not need to edit anything other than this block of code unless you are adding support for additional baud rates or devices.

   #  Choose one of the following MCUs:
   #    If you have a different MCU, you will have to define the
   #    BOOT_SECTION_START_IN_BYTES and FLASH_PAGE_SIZE_IN_BYTES for
   #    -section-start and the number of bytes to program at a time respectively.
   #    This information can be found in the iox....h file as BOOT_SECTION_START
   #    and PROGMEM_PAGE_SIZE.
   # MCU = atxmega128a1
   # MCU = atxmega64a3
   # MCU = atxmega32a4
   # MCU = atxmega16a4
     MCU = atxmega16d4
     
   # Choose a baud rate for the UART.
   #    If you need a baud rate that is not listed in this makefile, you must add
   #    new configuration statements in config.macros.h. Remember, Xmegas start-up
   #    with a 2MHz clock.
   # BAUD_RATE = 9600
   # BAUD_RATE = 38400
   # BAUD_RATE = 57600
     BAUD_RATE = 115200
     
   # Specify a pin to check for entry into the bootloader. The notation is
   # PORT,PIN. For example, if you wanted to use PIN 3 on PORTC, you would set
   # the option as C,3. Then specifiy the logic value required to enable the
   # bootloader code (1 = enable the bootloader if the pin is VCC, 0 = enable 
   # the bootloader if the pin is GND).
     BOOTLOADER_PIN    = B,2
     BOOTLOADER_PIN_ON = 1
     
   # Specify a pin to control an LED. The notation is PORT,PIN. For example, if
   # you wanted to use PIN 6 on PORTA, you would set the option as A,6. Then
   # specifiy the logic value required to enable the LED (1 = output VCC to turn
   # on the LED, 0 = output GND to turn on the LED).
     LED_PIN = D,2
     LED_ON  = 0
   
   # Specify which UART to use with PORT,NUM notation. For example, UART1 on
   # PORTD would be D,1.
     UART = C,0
